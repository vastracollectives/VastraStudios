## 🎨 Season 01: Monolith
Vastra Studios is the physical heartbeat of the VASTRA collective. Season 01, titled **Monolith**, is an exploration of architectural apparel—focusing on weight, drape, and the longevity of high-GSM Japanese and Indian textiles.

### Design System
- **Palette:** Bone (`#F7F3EF`), Charcoal (`#222222`), White (`#FFFFFF`).
- **Typography:** Architectural Serifs blended with precise Technical Sans-serifs.
- **Philosophy:** Drop & Archive. Once a silhouette is exhausted, it enters the permanent record.

## 🏛️ Digital Flagship Features
- **The Library**: A high-end editorial reading room detailing the brand's Mission, Origin, and Collective philosophy.
- **The Archive**: A technical museum (Permanent Record) of past explorations, featuring GSM specs and curator notes.
- **Member Access**: An exclusive entry portal for early-access drop coordination.
- **Custom Interaction**: A global minimalist cursor system that reacts to the site's architectural elements.
